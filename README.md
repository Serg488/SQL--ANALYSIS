# SQL--ANALYSIS
In these 2 weeks as the new Data Engineer for Pewlett Hackard, i have worked on giving the company information of previous employees from 1980s-1990s. Work consisted of inspecting csv files company had stored to analyze certain questions. I began Modeling the data using QuickDBD website creating a visual on my table analytics. After that, i drew in the data creating table schemas in PGAdmin4 app verifing my primary and foreign keys for the tables. Lastly analyzing the data i was able to list all employees imformation , departments, sex & salaries. With this data i was able to list frequency counts in decending order for all employees last names, list employees and managers by their departments and some employees that were hired in a specific year.
